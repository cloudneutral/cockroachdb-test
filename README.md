# CockroachDB Test

<img align="left" src="logo.png" />

The goal of this Java library is to provide for embedded database integration tests against 
a local [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) instance running either in [single node](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cockroach-start-single-node) 
mode or [demo](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cockroach-demo) mode. It supports both [Junit 4](http://junit.org/junit4/) and [Junit 5](http://junit.org/junit5/).

Integration tests are more realistic alternative than local [mock](https://site.mockito.org/) or fake/stub 
unit tests. One typical choice for database-oriented integration tests is 
to use [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) which a capable in-memory SQL database written in Java. 
The main limiting factor is that you are not really testing against CockroachDB 
but instead the dialect and semantics of H2.

CockroachDB is natively written in Go, and as such doesn't embed itself into a JVM instance.
A close alternative however, is to run a local and separate CockroachDB process that is 
controlled and governed by the integration test cycle. 

Using this test extension you can start with a clean machine, have the CockroachDB binary 
downloaded automatically, expanded and a local process started and initialized. At the
end of the test cycle, the inverse takes place where the process is stopped and all 
local files deleted. The downloaded binary can be cached and re-used between test runs
to speed things up.

## Supported Versions

* JUnit4
* JUnit5
* Linux, Mac and Windows
* CockroachDB Dedicated v23.1 or later

# Getting Started

A quick getting started guide using CockroachDB integration tests.

## Maven Configuration

Add this dependency to your `pom.xml` file if you are using Junit5:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cockroachdb.test</groupId>
    <artifactId>cockroachdb-test-junit5</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, if you are using Junit4:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cockroachdb.test</groupId>
    <artifactId>cockroachdb-test-junit4</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Then add the Maven repository to your `pom.xml` file (alternatively in Maven's [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html)):

```xml
<repository>
    <id>cockroachdb-test</id>
    <name>Maven Packages</name>
    <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/kai-niemi/cockroachdb-test</url>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
```

Next, you need to authenticate to GitHub Packages by creating a personal access token (classic)
that includes the `read:packages` scope. For more information, see [Authenticating to GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

Add your personal access token to the servers section in your [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html):

```xml
<server>
    <id>github</id>
    <username>your-github-name</username>
    <password>your-access-token</password>
</server>
```

Take note that the server and repository id's must be an exact match.

## JUnit5 Example

The highlights in the following example are the `@RegisterExtension` and `@Cockroach` annotations 
used to register and configure the CockroachDB extension. 

```java
@Cockroach(
        version = "v23.1.10",
        architecture = Cockroach.Architecture.amd64,
        command = Cockroach.Command.demo,
        demoFlags = @DemoFlags(global = true, nodes = 9)
)
public class CockroachJunit5Test {
    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());

    @RegisterExtension
    public static CockroachExtension cockroachExtension =
            CockroachExtension.builder()
                    .withTestClass(CockroachJunit5Test.class)
                    .build();

    private CockroachDetails cockroachDetails;

    public void setCockroachDetails(CockroachDetails cockroachDetails) {
        this.cockroachDetails = cockroachDetails;
    }

    @Test
    public void whenCockroachStarted_thenSayHelloAndWait() throws SQLException {
        Assertions.assertNotNull(cockroachDetails);

        logger.info("Attempting connection to [{}] with credentials {}/{}",
                cockroachDetails.getJdbcURL(),
                cockroachDetails.getUser(),
                cockroachDetails.getPassword());

        try (Connection db = DriverManager.getConnection(
                cockroachDetails.getJdbcURL(),
                cockroachDetails.getUser(),
                cockroachDetails.getPassword());
             Statement s = db.createStatement();
             ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery("SELECT 1+1")) {
            Assertions.assertTrue(rs.next());
            Assertions.assertEquals(2, rs.getInt(1));
        }
    }
}
```
